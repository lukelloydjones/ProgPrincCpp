Programming Principles and Practice using C++ - ExercisesThis repository contains my solutions and code from the programming exercises in the book "Programming Principles and Practice using C++ (2nd Edition)" by Bjarne Stroustrup.The purpose of this repository is to document my progress and provide a personal reference for the foundational concepts and programming principles discussed in the book.📚 About the Book"Programming Principles and Practice using C++" is a textbook designed for a first course in programming for college students. It provides a comprehensive introduction to programming fundamentals using the C++ language, focusing on practical skills and solid design principles.📁 Directory StructureThe code is organized by chapter to make it easy to navigate and find specific exercises..
├── Chapter_02
│   └── hello_world.cpp
├── Chapter_03
│   ├── basic_operations.cpp
│   ├── strings.cpp

└── etc...
Each directory corresponds to a chapter and contains the individual .cpp files for the exercises within that chapter.🛠️ How to Compile and Run the CodeTo compile and run these programs, you will need a C++ compiler such as g++.Required Header File:The book uses a custom header file called std_lib_facilities.h. You must have this file in the same directory as the .cpp file you are compiling, or in a location that your compiler can find. You can download the latest version of the header from Bjarne Stroustrup's official website.To Compile a single file:Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the file, and use the following command:g++ your_file_name.cpp -o your_file_name
g++ your_file_name.cpp tells the compiler to compile the specified source file.-o your_file_name specifies the name of the executable file that will be created.To Run the executable:./your_file_name
